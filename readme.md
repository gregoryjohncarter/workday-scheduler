# Workday Scheduler

## Purpose: 
- to allow the user to designate workday events on an interactive page
- select the timeslots to be able to edit the events
- background color of the events changes depending on if the time has or has not passed
- save tasks to local storage for persistence
- automatically check the time every 5 minutes to update background colors
